import type { ReactNode } from "react";

/**
 * Renders a translated string whose accent words are marked with `*asterisks*`,
 * and whose line breaks are written as `\n`.
 *
 * The display headings on this site set one word apart in italic serif — "Let's
 * *talk*.", "Invest in *China+1*". Splitting that into two catalogue keys (lead
 * + accent) would hard-code English word order: Russian puts the verb elsewhere,
 * German pushes it to the end, and a translator handed `{lead} <em>{accent}</em>`
 * cannot move it. One key with an inline marker lets the sentence be rearranged
 * freely and keeps the typography. The same argument applies to the line break —
 * where it falls depends on how long the words are in the target language.
 *
 * ## Why this returns a FLAT list
 *
 * It is rendered inside `SplitText`, whose `tokenize` walks `Children.toArray`
 * and understands exactly two things: bare strings (split into animatable words,
 * remembering which had a trailing space) and `<br>` elements (turned into line
 * breaks). Anything else is taken whole as a single word token.
 *
 * So wrapping text in `<Fragment>` — the obvious way to key a mapped list —
 * breaks both features at once: the fragment becomes one opaque token with no
 * trailing space, so "Invest in" runs into the accent word; and a `<br>` hidden
 * inside it is never recognised, so it renders *within* an `inline-block` and
 * turns that span into a two-line box with a large vertical gap. Both of those
 * shipped in #157 and were visible on the production hero.
 *
 * Strings therefore stay strings and `<br>`s stay siblings. React requires keys
 * only for elements in an array, not for strings, so nothing is lost.
 *
 * ## Inside `SplitText`, call {@link accented} instead
 *
 * `SplitText` inspects its children. A *server* `<Accented>` is already rendered
 * by the time it gets there, so it sees the flat list — but from a **client**
 * component the element is still unrendered, so it becomes one opaque token
 * (no per-word motion) and `flattenText` finds no `children` to recurse into,
 * leaving the screen-reader label EMPTY. The heading then announces as nothing.
 *
 * Calling the function inlines the nodes as real children either way, so
 * `SplitText` call sites use `{accented(...)}` and nothing else has to know
 * whether it is running on the server.
 *
 * Deliberately not Markdown, and deliberately not `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`: the
 * only things that need expressing are "this word is the accent" and "break
 * here", and a two-character convention keeps translator-authored strings inert.
 *
 * @example
 * ```tsx
 * <Accented text={t("contact.title")} />   // "Let's *talk*." → Let's <em>talk</em>.
 *
 * // Two accents in different tones — the hero's China+1 / Vietnam pair.
 * <Accented
 *   text={t("home.hero.headline.a")}
 *   classNames={["… text-main-accent-t1", "… text-main-accent-t2"]}
 * />
 * ```
