 * `className="sm:hidden"`); every child becomes one slide, so the same card
 * nodes can feed both a desktop grid and this carousel without duplication.

            from a fully-opaque background edge (pitch black) over a narrow band,
            which reads as a hard wall rather than a "more to come" hint. Cap the
            peak well below solid and spread it wider so it eases in — the
            minimum tint that still signals off-screen slides. transition-none
            kills the stock 300ms opacity cross-fade: mid-swipe it left BOTH
            edges dark at once (the old side fading out while the new faded in),
            which read as side shadows on every switch. */}
