// namespace and the path differ, so they live here as arguments rather than as
// five copies that drift apart — which is the real risk, not the line count: a
// page whose title says one thing and whose canonical points somewhere else is
// invisible until a crawler tells you.
//
// Routes that need request data to build their metadata (the [slug] pages fetch
// a record and branch on 404) are deliberately NOT expressed here — they share
// the shape but not the logic, and folding them in would mean a helper with a
// switch in it.

/// Title and description for every static page under app/[locale], in one
/// place. Both halves are stated per namespace, so a page cannot be given a
/// title with no description — the shape a hand-written `meta.${ns}.title`
/// lookup could not enforce.
