// The registry maps logical names to {tag, scriptUrl, kind}. Independent deploys
// land by editing this file (or, in production, a per-env config) — never by
// rebuilding landing. Served openly to the browser via /api/mfe-registry, so its
// scriptUrls are operator-controlled and public — treat registry edits as code.
