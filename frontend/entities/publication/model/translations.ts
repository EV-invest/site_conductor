/**
 * Card translations for publications, and the resolver that applies them.
 *
 * ## Why this is a separate file from `catalogue.json`
 *
 * `catalogue.json` is a **build artefact** — the blog flake overwrites it
 * wholesale before `next build`. A translation written into it would survive
 * exactly until the next real build and then vanish, silently, with the site
 * still rendering fine in English. So the translations live here, in a tracked
 * file the build never touches, and are merged over the artefact at read time.
 *
 * ## Card, not document
 *
 * What is translated here is the *card*: title, dek, quote, category — what
 * appears on `/publications`, in the masthead, in a shared link's preview. The
 * document itself is a compiled Typst report living in the `blog` repo and is
 * not translated by anything in this repo. `Publication.locales` remains the
 * record of which locales the **document** exists in, which is what
 * {@link hasTranslatedDocument} reads; keeping the two separate is what lets the
 * article page say honestly that the body is in English while its heading is
 * not.
 *
 * ## Rule 1.2, per field
 *
 * Each entry stores the English it was translated from, exactly like the message
 * catalogues, and a field whose English has since moved is refused — the current
 * English is rendered instead of a translation of a sentence nobody writes any
 * more.
 *
 * Per *field*, not per entry as vacancies do it. That difference is deliberate:
 * a vacancy is rewritten wholesale, so a row-level digest matches how the
 * content changes, whereas a publication's dek can be re-edited while its title
 * stands, and these four independent strings behave far more like catalogue
 * entries than like a row.
