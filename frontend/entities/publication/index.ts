// `publication` entity — the single read surface over the publications
// catalogue (research reports, the whitepaper, field notes) that /publications,
// its detail routes and the sitemap share.
//
// The catalogue itself is build-produced and deliberately not exported: callers
// ask questions (`findPublication`, `fieldNotes`, …) instead of scanning an
// array, so the storage can move behind these names without touching consumers.
