/**
 * The four competences the intro sentence already names, pulled out as their own
 * row. The order is deliberate — it is the order the work happens in, not the
 * order the partners rank in.
 *
 * There are four for a structural reason: this block sits directly above a 4-up
 * grid (portraits on the homepage, offices and roles on /team). A three-column
 * strip over a four-column grid reads as a row that failed to fill; matching the
 * count makes the two blocks share one set of column edges, which is the whole
 * job of a text band between two grids.

 * Shared leadership intro — a text-only band: eyebrow and display heading on the
 * left, the positioning sentence on the right, and the four competences beneath
 * on the grid the section below already uses. Single source for both the
 * homepage Team section and the /team page, so the copy never drifts.
 *
 * It carried a boardroom photograph unconditionally until v0.2.62, on the
 * argument that the picture did no work the sentence beside it wasn't already
 * doing and gave the section two focal points before the reader reached a single
 * face. `team_office` now measures that argument instead of assuming it: `a` is
 * the text-only band, `b` restores the photograph. Only the picture is switched —
 * the heading, sentence and pillars are one copy shared by both variants.
