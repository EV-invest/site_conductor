// DRAFT — pending legal review (site_conductor #204). Not legal advice; a
// template for counsel to edit. Every mechanism described (NAV-priced units,
// queued redemptions, the order book, USDT on TRON, Turnkey custody) is what
// the platform's code does today; nothing here asserts insurance, a guarantee
// or a regulatory protection.
