// DRAFT — pending legal review (site_conductor #204). Not legal advice; a
// template for counsel to edit. Bracketed tokens ([LEGAL NAME], [JURISDICTION],
// …) are placeholders the owner fills before this page ships. Every factual
// claim below is one the platform's code enforces today (Google sign-in, Didit
// verification, Turnkey custody, USDT on TRON, NAV-priced units, fees settled
// in units); nothing here asserts a licence, insurance or regulatory status.
