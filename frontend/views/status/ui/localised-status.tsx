/**
 * The 404 / 403 / 401 surfaces, in the reader's language.
 *
 * The uikit's ready-made `NotFound` / `Forbidden` / `ServerError` bake their copy
 * in, which is why these pages were English under Russian chrome — a reader who
 * had navigated the whole site in their own language met an English apology at
 * the one moment the site was already failing them. `StatusScreen` is the same
 * component underneath and takes every string as a prop, so this needs no uikit
 * release.
 *
 * 401 has no uikit page at all: `authInterrupts` gives Next both `forbidden()`
 * and `unauthorized()`, and only the former had a file. An `unauthorized()` call
 * would have fallen through to the generic error boundary.
 *
 * Server-rendered on purpose. The catalogues are ~176 KB across five locales;
 * reading the locale on the client would ship all of them to render a page
 * nobody wants to be on. The 500 cannot use this — Next requires `error.tsx` to
 * be a Client Component — and takes its copy from `StatusCopyProvider` instead.
