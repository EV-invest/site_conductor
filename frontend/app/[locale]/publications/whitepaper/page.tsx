// The page was shipping `robots: index, follow` with a self-canonical while
// being excluded from the sitemap AND from ROUTES for the opposite reason (see
// shared/config/site.ts): its body mounts client-side in a shadow root, so
// there is no text in the SSR HTML for a crawler to index — a thin page
// advertised as indexable. `noindex` makes the metadata agree with the
// sitemap/ROUTES exclusion instead of contradicting it; `follow` stays true so
// its outbound links (the PDF download, the way back to /publications) still
// pass link equity.

// isolated in a shadow root (`isolate`) instead of taking the host's prose.
// That is also why it stays out of the sitemap — see shared/config/site.ts.
