//! Config drift watch: the k8s Secret this process was configured from is
//! mounted as a directory of files, so — unlike the environment, which is fixed
//! at `exec` — it *does* change under a running process (a kubelet re-syncs it
//! about once a minute). Reading it is this adapter's job; the comparison lives
//! in `ev_lib::settings::drift`.
//!
//! Detect and alert only. Applying a change means a redeploy, so that what is
//! running keeps matching the gitops commit that describes it.
