/// Emits the wrapper half of a validated string newtype: the declaration, the
/// derives, the transparent serde representation and the two accessors. The
/// leading `$(#[$meta:meta])*` carries each type's own doc comment through, so
/// the validation policy stays documented on the type it governs.
///
/// `parse` is deliberately *not* generated. Every one of these types validates
/// something different, with its own error strings and its own tests pinning
/// them, so each module writes its own `parse` in a plain `impl` block beside
/// the invocation.
///
/// `#[serde(transparent)]` is part of the contract rather than an incidental
/// derive: the wire format of all of these is the bare string.
